Description: Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical technique that combines factor analysis and multiple regression to evaluate and test complex relationships between observed and latent variables within a hypothesized model.    This package utilizes this method to analyze a travel behavior and satisfaction-related questionnaire dataset that was collected during July to August on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
