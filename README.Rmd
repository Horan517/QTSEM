# QTSEM

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of QTSEM is to present a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) example in R. It uses a travel behavior and collected during July to August on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as the example dataset. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of QTSEM from GitHub with:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){
    install.packages("remotes")
    library(remotes)
}
remotes::install_github("Horan517/QTSEM")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(QTSEM)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
